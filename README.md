# WProtection


## Implementation

* Run the installation SQL scripts
* Rename WProtection/classes/settings.sample.php WProtection/classes/settings.php
* Update the information within WProtection/classes/settings.php
* Rename the class from settingsSample to settings

And, inshallah, the application will run.
